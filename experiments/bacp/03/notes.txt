bacp problem model: with 3-layer constraint enabled

bacp generator and irace's param file: created by conjure, with:
    prerequisite_cardMin and prerequisite_cardMax domain being int(1..50) instead of int(0..50) to make sure prerequisite is not empty
    3-layer constraint added as decision variable (level)

repair.essence: generated by conjure but with a number of extra constraints manually added to avoid unsat generator instances
